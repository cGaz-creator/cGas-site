## What is cGAS?

**cGAS** is a synthetic ERC-20 token designed to mirror the **natural gas** price via an on-chain oracle. It supports **mint/burn** against stablecoins and is designed for transparency and non-custodial operation.

**Key ideas**
- Transparent pricing from reputable commodity sources  
- On-chain controls: pause, roles, and upgrade safety  
- Simple UX: mint/burn against a stablecoin  

## Roadmap (high level)
- ✅ Testnet deployments & internal tests  
- 🚧 Oracle & price updater hardening (alerts, monitoring)  
- 🗳️ Governance: towards a DAO where holders can vote on fees, oracles, and updates  

> After launch, cGAS will evolve into a **DAO**. Holders will vote on **fees**, **oracles**, and **protocol updates** — returning power to the community.
